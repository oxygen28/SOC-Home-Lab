# SOC Home Lab (LimaCharlie)

## Objective
The SOC Home Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks, fostering hands-on experience in cybersecurity. Following the guidance provided by [Eric's blog series](https://blog.ecapuano.com/p/so-you-want-to-be-a-soc-analyst-intro?sd=pf), the project focused on leveraging various tools and techniques to simulate real-world attack scenarios, ingest and analyze logs within a security operations platform, and develop effective detection and response strategies. By employing these tools and skills, the SOC Home Lab project provided valuable hands-on experience, deepening understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.
### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding and practical application of endpoint telemetry collection and analysis concepts.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting endpoint telemetry data to identify potential threats.
- Ability to generate and recognize indicators of compromise (IOCs) and behavioral patterns indicative of malicious activity.
- Enhanced knowledge of endpoint security protocols and common vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills specific to endpoint security and incident response.
- Creation of detection and response rules tailored to endpoint telemetry and behavior analysis in LimaCharlie EDR.
### Tools Used
- Telemetry generation tools for simulating realistic endpoint activity and attack scenarios.
- LimaCharlie EDR for observing endpoint telemetry data and creating custom detection and response rules tailored to specific threat scenarios.
