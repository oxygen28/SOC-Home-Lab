# Scanning with YARA rules
I am going to create YARA rule to detect the Sliver C2 payload that we created earlier.

## Create YARA rule for Sliver C2
### LimaCharlie
1. At LimaCharlie, go to "Automation" > "YARA Rules" and click on "Add Yara Rule"

2. Create the YARA rule to detect Sliver, here I am going to use the available [YARA rule created by UK National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-further-TTPs-associated-with-SVR-cyber-actors.pdf).
   ```
	rule sliver_github_file_paths_function_names {
	  meta:
	    author = "NCSC UK"
	    description = "Detects Sliver Windows and Linux implants based on paths and function names within the binary"
	  strings:
	    $p1 = "/sliver/"
	    $p2 = "sliverpb."
	    $fn1 = "RevToSelfReq"
	    $fn2 = "ScreenshotReq"
	    $fn3 = "IfconfigReq"
	    $fn4 = "SideloadReq"
	    $fn5 = "InvokeMigrateReq"
	    $fn6 = "KillSessionReq"
	    $fn7 = "ImpersonateReq"
	    $fn8 = "NamedPipesReq"
	  condition:
	    (uint32(0) == 0x464C457F or (uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint16(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550)) and (all of ($p*) or 3 of ($fn*))
	}
	
	rule sliver_proxy_isNotFound_retn_cmp_uniq {
	  meta:
	    author = "NCSC UK"
	    description = "Detects Sliver implant framework based on some unique CMPs within the Proxy isNotFound function. False positives may occur"
	  strings:
	    $ = {C644241800C381F9B3B5E9B2}
	    $ = {8B481081F90CAED682}
	  condition:
	    (uint32(0) == 0x464C457F or (uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint16(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550)) and all of them
	}
	
	rule sliver_nextCCServer_calcs {
	  meta:
	    author = "NCSC UK"
	    description = "Detects Sliver implant framework based on instructions from the nextCCServer function. False positives may occur"
	  strings:
	    $ = {4889D3489948F7F94839CA????48C1E204488B0413488B4C1308}
	  condition:
	    (uint32(0) == 0x464C457F or (uint16(0) == 0x5A4D and uint16(uint32(0x3c)) == 0x4550)) and all of them
	}
	```

3. Save the rule as "sliver".
4. Create another YARA rule to detect for running processes, as the YARA rule from NCSC does not work on scanning running processes. Here I will extract the strings used by the C2 payload from the "Memory Strings" of the C2 payload in the "Processes" page.

   I searched for the keyword "sliver" and found the strings below.

5. Create YARA rule based on the above findings.
   ```
   rule sliver_strings {
		meta: 
		   author = "Gabriel Kuek"
		   description = "Detects Sliver C2 based on the strings within the binary, inspired by NCSC UK."
		strings:
			$p1 = "/sliver/"
			$p2 = "sliverpb"
		condition:
			all of ($p*)
   }
	```

## Create D&R rules for YARA detection.
Based on the [documentation by LimaCharlie](https://docs.limacharlie.io/docs/detection-and-response-examples#yara-detections), which provided the example to create the D&R rule for YARA detection on-disk and in-memory.
   
![](https://i.imgur.com/AKO0GcF.png)

**YARA Detection On-Disk (file)**
```
# Detection
event: YARA_DETECTION
op: and
rules:
  - not: true
	op: exists
	path: event/PROCESS/*
  - op: exists
	path: event/RULE_NAME

# Response
- action: report
  name: YARA Detection on Disk - {{ .event.RULE_NAME }}
- action: add tag
  tag: yara_detection_disk
  ttl: 80000
```

**YARA Detection In-Memory (process)**
```
	# Detection
event: YARA_DETECTION
op: and
rules:
  - op: exists
	path: event/RULE_NAME
  - op: exists
	path: event/PROCESS/*

# Response
- action: report
  name: YARA Detection in Memory - {{ .event.RULE_NAME }}
- action: add tag
  tag: yara_detection_memory
  ttl: 80000
```
### LimaCharlie
1. At LimaCharlie, head over to the "D&R Rules" page and click on the "+ New Rule".
   
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/WEOant2.png)
2. Create the rule for both YARA Detection On-Disk and YARA Detection In-Memory.
   
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/b2Ka4JD.png)
3. Test the YARA rule created earlier by going to the "Console" page of the Sensor. Input the command below to the console and change the payload name to the C2 payload generated.
   ```
   - yara_scan hive://yara/sliver -f C:\Users\User\Downloads\SHARP_BUCKLE.exe
	```
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/D09GcTD.png)
   The output above shows that the YARA rule matches the C2 payload. At the "Detections" page, the YARA detection will also be triggered.

## Create D&R rules for YARA scanning.
Based on the [documentation by LimaCharlie](https://docs.limacharlie.io/docs/detection-and-response-examples#yara-scanning), which provided the example to create the D&R rule for YARA scanning downloaded executable and the running processes.

![](https://i.imgur.com/AgMlmn5.png)

**Scan Downloaded EXE**
```
# Detection
event: NEW_DOCUMENT
op: and
rules:
  - op: starts with
    path: event/FILE_PATH
    value: C:\Users\
  - op: contains
    path: event/FILE_PATH
    value: \Downloads\

# Response
## Report is optional, but informative
- action: report
  name: EXE in Downloads directory
## Initiate a sensor command to yara scan the File Path
- action: task
  command: yara_scan hive://yara/sliver -f "{{ .event.FILE_PATH }}"
  investigation: Yara Scan Exe
  suppression:
    is_global: false
    keys:
      - '{{ .event.PROCESS_ID }}'
      - Yara Scan Exe
    max_count: 1
    period: 1m
```

**Scan Running Process**
```
# Detection
event: NEW_PROCESS
op: and
rules:
  - op: starts with
    path: event/FILE_PATH
    value: C:\Users\
  - op: contains
    path: event/FILE_PATH
    value: \Downloads\

# Response
## Report is optional, but informative
- action: report
  name: Execution from Downloads directory
## Initiate a sensor command to yara scan the PROCESS_ID
- action: task
  command: yara_scan hive://yara/sliver-process --pid "{{ .event.PROCESS_ID }}"
  investigation: Yara Scan Process
  suppression:
    is_global: false
    keys:
      - '{{ .event.PROCESS_ID }}'
      - Yara Scan Process
    max_count: 1
    period: 1m
```
1. At the "D&R Rules" page, click on "+ New Rule"
   
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/WEOant2.png)
2. Create the rule with the example provided by LimaCharlie to scan downloaded EXE, but the response is tweaked to scan for the file path instead of the process ID.

3. Create the rule with the example provided by LimaCharlie to scan processes.

## Trigger the YARA scanning rule for downloaded EXE
### Windows VM
Simulate the payload just dropped into the "Downloads" directory.
1. Move the downloaded payload out of the "Downloads" directory.
```
Move-Item -Path C:\Users\User\Downloads\SHARP_BUCKLE.exe -Destination C:\Users\User\Documents\SHARP_BUCKLE.exe
```
2. Move the payload back into the "Downloads" directory.
```
Move-Item -Path C:\Users\User\Documents\SHARP_BUCKLE.exe -Destination C:\Users\User\Downloads\SHARP_BUCKLE.exe
```

### LimaCharlie
1. Head over to the "Detections" page to see what happened.
   
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/uYZg8ik.png)
   It shows that the 2 rules created earlier:
	1. The first rule is "EXE in Downloads directory" which will detect for any dropped files in the downloads directory and trigger the YARA scan.
	2. The YARA scan shows that the file matches the YARA rules created.

## Trigger the YARA scanning rule for running processes
### Windows VM
1. Kill any running instance of the Sliver C2 by getting into Administrative Powershell
   ```
   cd C:\Users\User\Downloads
   Get-Process SHARP_BUCKLE | Stop-Process
	```
2. Execute the Sliver payload to create the NEW_PROCESS event, that is used to trigger the YARA scanning of the process launched from downloads directory.
   ```
   C:\Users\User\Downloads\SHARP_BUCKLE.exe
	```

### LimaCharlie
1. Head over to the "Detections" page to see what happened.
   
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/b0rLmCm.png)

   It shows that the 2 rules created earlier:
	1. The first rule is "Execution from Downloads directory" which will detect for any execution process in the downloads directory and trigger the YARA scan.
	2. The YARA scan shows that the file matches the YARA rules created.
