# Tuning False Positive

## Creating False Positive rules
### LimaCharlie
1. Head over to the "Detection & Response Rule" page and create a rule for detection of "svhost.exe" execution which is normal Windows process.

2. Create the rule as follow:
   - Detect
     ```
		events:
		- NEW_PROCESS
		op: contains
		path: event/FILE_PATH
		value: svchost.exe
		```
- Response
  ```
  - action: report
	  name: Suspicious svchost execution
	```

3. Save the rule as "Suspicious SVC"

## Tune the False Positive rules
Based on the [EchoTrail ](https://www.echotrail.io/)insights on "[svchost.exe](https://www.echotrail.io/d/insights?query=svchost.exe&type=basic)". It shows the Top Path for the executable which can be used in the False Positive tuning.

Other than that, [Hunt Evil poster](https://www.sans.org/posters/hunt-evil/)by SANS that show what is the **normal** events in Windows which can be used to cut out the false positive.

With those information, we can then create a false positive rule to rule out the false positives that might be created by the legitimate processes.
### LimaCharlie
1. On LimaCharlie, we can see that the "Detection" page is filled with the false positives from the "Suspicious svchost executions" rules created earlier.

2. Click on the "Mark False Positive" button to create a rule to determine the false positive.

3. Create the detect rule as follow:
   ```
   op: and
	rules:
	  - op: is
    path: cat
    value: Suspicous svchost execution
	  - op: matches
    path: detect/event/FILE_PATH
    re: (?i)^c:\\windows\\system32\\svchost\.exe$
    case sensitive: false
	  - op: contains
    path: detect/event/COMMAND_LINE
    value: -k
	```
	*The regex expression is used to detect the file path because I noticed that there's some event with System32 instead of system32. Hence the not case sensitive used.*

4. Test the detection rule against the false positive events detected.

5. Save the rule.
