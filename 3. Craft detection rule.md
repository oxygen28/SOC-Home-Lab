# Craft detection rule
### Ubuntu Server
1. Connect to the Ubuntu Server via SSH, and drop into the C2 session via Sliver as shown [2. Generate and observe telemetry - Generate the C2 payload](2.%20Generate%20and%20observe%20telemetry.md#Generate-the-C2-payload).
2. Check for privilege by running the command below in Sliver:
   `getprivs`
   If there is `SeDebugPrivilege`, then it would be good to go.
3. Dump the lsass.exe process from memory to steal credentials.
   `procdump -n lsass.exe -s lsass.dmp`

### LimaCharlie
1. After doing adversarial action such as dumping the lsass.exe process, head over to LimaCharlie to find the telemetry relevant to that process.
2. At LimaCharlie, head over to "Timeline" and Add filters for the `routing.event_type is SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS` which will trigger for any lsass.exe usage.

   The lsass.exe can be seen to be executed from the COMBATIVE_SHEET.exe.
3. Click on the "Build D&R Rule" on the top right of the event details.

4. In the "Detect" section, replace the rule with the following:
```
event: SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS
op: ends with
path: event/*/TARGET/FILE_PATH
value: lsass.exe
```
- This detection rule will only look at the "SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS" event where the victim or the target process ends with lsass.exe. (*This rule will be very noisy and need further tuning in production environment*)
5. In the "Respond" section, replace the rule with the following:
  ```
- action: report
  name: LSASS access
```
- The response would be generating a detection report alert whenever the detection occurs. However more response could be added such as terminating the offending process chain and so on.
6. Test the rule against the event by clicking on the "Target Event" and "Test Event" below the D&R Rule written.

7. Scroll up and save the D&R rule.

8. Re-run the same procdump command as before and at the "Detection" tab on the right panel. The detection will be shown, and the detection can also be brought to the "Timeline" by clicking on the "View Event Timeline" to view more details about the triggered event.
