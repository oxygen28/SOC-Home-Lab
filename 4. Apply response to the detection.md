# Create Detection Rules
### Ubuntu Server
1. Get back to Ubuntu Server via SSH and drop into the C2 session as shown in [2. Generate and observe telemetry - Generate the C2 payload](2.%20Generate%20and%20observe%20telemetry.md#Generate-the-C2-payload)
2. In the C2 session, run the command `shell` to get into the shell of the Windows VM and hit "Yes" on prompt asking "This action is bad OPSEC, are you an adult?".
3. In the system shell, run the following command:
   ```
   vssadmin delete shadows /all
	```
	This command will delete the shadow copies on the machine, it's the backup copy create by the machine. In the case of an ransomware attack, this command would be the first to be executed as the attacker would not want the victim to be able to perform recovery of the machine.
4. Run `whoami` to verify that the system shell is still active.

### LimaCharlie
1. Head over to the "Detection" tab and see if the Sigma rules detected the vssadmin delete action.

   The sigma rules will also show the metadata of the detection and also references which will help to understand why the detection exists in the first place.
2. Click on the "View Event Timeline" to view the raw event that generated this detection.

3. Craft a new detection rule and add the following to the Respond:
   ```
	- action: report
	  name: vss_deletion_kill_it
	- action: task
	  command:
	    - deny_tree
	    - <<routing/parent>>
	```
	- The “action: report” section simply fires off a Detection report to the “Detections” tab
	- The “action: [task](https://doc.limacharlie.io/docs/documentation/b43d922abb409-reference-actions#task)” section is what is responsible for killing the parent process responsible with [deny_tree](https://doc.limacharlie.io/docs/documentation/819e855933d6c-reference-commands#deny_tree) for the `vssadmin delete shadows /all` command.

4. Save the new detection rule.

### Ubuntu Server
1. Get into the shell of the windows again and re-run the same attack.

### Lima Charlie
1. Back to LimaCharlie, at the "Detection" tab. The detection rule should detect the attack.

2. By clicking on the "View Event Timeline", we can observe the raw event that generated this detection.

# Edit the detection rule 
### LimaCharlie
1. Go to the detection and response page, and click on the "vss_deletion_kill_it" rule.
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/aRNQ8kM.png)
2. Tweak the rule as follow:
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/dcXJiHJ.png)
   The rule is tweaked in a way that it does not just detect based on the literal string where all the string will need to match for the detection to be triggered. Therefore, by using operators (*contains*) will allow for better matching of the rule.

# Test the rule against a malware simulator
### Windows VM
1. Download the [malware simulator](https://github.com/NextronSystems/ransomware-simulator) on GitHub, with the following behaviour:
   - Staging from a Word document macro
   - Deleting Volume Shadow Copies
   - Encrypting documents (embedded and dropped by the simulator into a new folder)
   - Dropping a ransomware note to the user's desktop
2. Running the QuickBuck.exe (Malware Simulator) and it is stopped right after the deleting volume shadow copies process.

### LimaCharlie
1. At LimaCharlie, it is detected via the detection rule.

2. By viewing the process tree, we can see the flow of execution for the malware. It can be seen that the malware is terminated.

# Delete the malware as response
*To experiment more on the response of the detection. I tried adding a task to delete the parent file as well. However, this should not be used in production as it might delete legitimate file.*
### LimaCharlie
1. Head over to the detection & response rule page.
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/tTxXXK4.png)
2. Add the commands below to the Respond of the rule:
   ![](https://i.imgur.com/f01wdZA.png)
   ```
   - action: task
	   command:
		   - file_del
		   - <<event/PARENT/FILE_PATH>>
	```
	- The `file_del` command can be found at the [sensors command](https://docs.limacharlie.io/v1/docs/sensor-commands-files-and-directories)for files and directories.
	- The file path to the parent file is obtained via the raw event generated during the detection:

### Windows VM
1. Run the malware simulator again, and it can be seen that the file that execute the command had been deleted.

### LimaCharlie
1. At the event timeline, it can be seen that the parent file that executed the command `vssadmin delete shadow /all` had been deleted from the machine.

2. The file had been deleted from the Windows VM. However, this is should not be used in production environment as it might delete legitimate file.
